          I am a Senior Software Development Engineer who is always discovering
          something new. As a developer solving problems by thinking from the
          client side is one of great quality. Designing an application that is
          truly helpful to the user by using my creative thoughts and
          problem-solving skills is my ultimate goal. I am always ready to learn
          new technologies for the client's requirements and fix them with code.
          Being a web developer, I learned how to learn without missing
          deadlines.
